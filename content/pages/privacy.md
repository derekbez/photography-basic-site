**Privacy & Cookies**

Short version: we don’t collect anything clever. No tracking scripts, no analytics, no mysterious data hoovering — just a small cookie/localStorage flag to remember that you agreed to the cookie notice. We use it purely to stop the banner from bothering you again.

***

### What we do (and don’t)

• We use a tiny cookie/localStorage value to remember whether you accepted the cookie notice.
• We do not run external analytics, advertising, or fingerprinting on this site.
• We don’t sell your data — we don’t have any to sell, and we don’t aspire to.

***

### Your choices

If you prefer not to accept cookies from this site, you can:

- Use your browser settings to block or clear cookies.
- Remove the banner state manually by opening DevTools and running: `localStorage.removeItem('cookie_consent_v1')` and reloading the page.

***

### Questions or requests

If you think we’re doing something odd, or you want us to remove any stored preference for you manually, drop a line to the site contact (if you can find it) and we’ll help — politely and with a small dose of contrition.

Thanks for reading. You can go back to photographing things now — the camera will probably forgive you.
