I'm Derek Bezuidenhout, a photographer with a passion for helping others understand how cameras work and how to make intentional, meaningful photographs.

This site is a teaching resource — a collection of practical lessons on photography fundamentals. You'll find clear explanations of exposure, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, composition, depth of field, and the creative choices behind each setting. The goal is simple: to help you move from guessing to understanding, so you can take control of your camera and make photographs that say what you want them to say.


## Also find me elsewhere

- [derekbez.com](https://derekbez.com) — My portfolio and project site. Expect curated galleries of Nature, People and Society.

- [Derek on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DerekBezuidenhout) — A calm, observational window into the natural world. The videos linger on birds, insects, and quiet landscapes with a gentle, unhurried style.

If you find something interesting on either of those places, I’d love to hear about it.  Use the Contact page at derekbez.com.
