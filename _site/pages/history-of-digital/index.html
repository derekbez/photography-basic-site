      <p><strong>A Brief History of Digital Cameras</strong></p>
<p>Digital cameras have come a long way in a surprisingly short time. If you were around in the late 1990s, you may remember the excitement of the first <em>proper</em> digital point‑and‑shoots — chunky, plasticky, and with memory cards so tiny in capacity that you could store about eight photos before needing to delete something. But they were incredible for their time. No film! Instant viewing! Space‑age stuff.</p>
<p>Let’s take a little journey from those early beginnings through to the DSLRs that followed, and then into the mirrorless cameras many people use today.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Point‑and‑Shoot Cameras (late 1990s – early 2000s)</h3>
<p>The late 1990s saw the arrival of mainstream digital point‑and‑shoots. These cameras were designed to be small, simple, and fully automatic.</p>
<p>Some common features of early digital point‑and‑shoots:</p>
<p>• A fixed, non‑interchangeable lens<br>
• Modest zoom ranges<br>
• Very small sensors<br>
• Rear screens that looked like something from a 1990s video game<br>
• Memory cards that felt futuristic but filled up instantly</p>
<p>They weren’t designed for manual control or artistic experimentation — the camera made almost all the decisions for you. But they made photography accessible, fun, and digital for the first time.</p>
<hr>
<h3>DSLRs (early 2000s onwards)</h3>
<p>As digital technology improved, manufacturers began replacing film in traditional SLR (single‑lens reflex) camera bodies with digital sensors. This gave birth to the <strong>DSLR</strong> — the Digital Single‑Lens Reflex camera — which dominated serious photography for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>A DSLR is built around a clever little system of mirrors. Here’s how it works, simply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Light comes through the lens.</li>
<li>It hits a <strong>mirror</strong> angled at 45 degrees.</li>
<li>That mirror reflects the light up into a small optical viewfinder.</li>
<li>When you take a photo, the mirror flips up out of the way.</li>
<li>The shutter opens, letting light hit the sensor.</li>
<li>The shutter closes, the mirror drops back down, and your view returns.</li>
</ol>
<p>This mechanism is why DSLRs have that distinctive “clack‑clack” sound — a tiny ballet of moving parts happening in milliseconds.</p>
<p>DSLRs also brought something that would shape photography for the next generation:</p>
<p><strong>interchangeable lenses.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to swap lenses opened up a whole world of possibilities — wide‑angles, telephotos, macro lenses, portrait lenses — each designed to show the world in a different way. Once you start exploring lenses, you truly begin to discover the creative power of photography.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Mirrorless Cameras (2010s onwards)</h3>
<p>Eventually, technology allowed camera makers to rethink the whole DSLR structure. If you remove the mirror and prism, the camera can be made smaller, lighter, and more efficient. This led to the rise of the <strong>mirrorless</strong> camera.</p>
<p>In a mirrorless camera:</p>
<p>• There is <strong>no mirror</strong> reflecting light upwards.<br>
• Instead, the sensor receives light directly.<br>
• What the sensor “sees” is shown electronically on the rear screen or in an electronic viewfinder.</p>
<p>Because the mirror box was no longer needed, camera bodies could shrink noticeably. And with fewer moving parts, mirrorless cameras introduced a quieter, sleeker way to take photographs while still offering interchangeable lenses — a key feature inherited from DSLRs.</p>
<hr>
<h3>A Continuing Evolution</h3>
<p>As digital cameras matured, manufacturers entered what became known as the race for megapixels. Early point‑and‑shoots proudly offered 1 or 2 megapixels, which seemed extraordinary at the time. Within a few years, cameras leapt to 5, then 10, then 20 megapixels and beyond. While megapixels aren’t everything, they symbolised the rapid pace of improvement — each new generation offering more detail, better enlargements, and sharper images.</p>
<p>But megapixels weren’t the only advance. Sensors became far better at handling low light. Image processors grew faster and more intelligent. Autofocus systems developed from simple, slow point‑and‑lock methods into astonishingly quick systems that can track moving subjects with ease. Screens and viewfinders improved from tiny, grainy displays to crisp, high‑resolution panels. Even storage evolved, from tiny memory cards that held a handful of photos to modern cards capable of storing thousands.</p>
<p>Through all these changes, digital cameras have continued to grow more capable, more reliable, and more enjoyable to use. Yet no matter how far the technology has come — or how far it goes next — the real magic remains exactly where it always has been: with the person behind the camera, choosing what to capture and how to see the world.</p>
