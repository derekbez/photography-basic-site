      <p><strong>The Exposure Triangle Reloaded</strong></p>
<p>Now that we’ve explored ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed separately, let’s revisit how these three settings interact — and how you can make them work together for your everyday photography.</p>
<img src="/img/Exposure-Triangle-20260203.png" alt="Exposure Triangle" class="img-medium">
<hr>
<h3>ISO</h3>
<p>ISO controls how sensitive your camera’s sensor is to light.<br>
Higher ISO values make the sensor more sensitive, which means you can shoot in darker conditions. The drawback is increased <strong>noise</strong>, which can make your images look grainy or less clean.</p>
<p>So, in most situations, aim to use the <strong>lowest practical ISO</strong> for the light you have.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Aperture</h3>
<p>Aperture is the size of the opening in the lens. A wide opening lets in more light; a narrow one lets in less.</p>
<p>Aperture is also one of your most powerful <strong>creative tools</strong>. It controls how much of the scene appears in focus (depth of field):</p>
<p>• <strong>Narrow aperture (big f-number like f/16)</strong> → most of the scene in focus<br>
• <strong>Wide aperture (small f-number like f/2.8)</strong> → shallow focus, blurred background</p>
<p>Using a wide aperture is a great way to make your subject stand out against a softer, less distracting background.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Shutter Speed</h3>
<p>Shutter Speed is how long the sensor is exposed to light.</p>
<p>A slow shutter speed gives the subject (or camera!) more time to move, creating blur. This can be wonderful for creative effects — flowing water, moving crowds, spinning wheels.</p>
<p>Most of the time, though, you’ll want sharper images, so you’ll use <strong>faster shutter speeds</strong> to freeze motion.</p>
<hr>
<h3>It’s a balancing act</h3>
<img src="/img/20080925_0137.jpg" alt="Balancing" class="img-medium">
<p>Here’s my general approach — not a strict rulebook, just a reliable starting point. Try it, adjust it, and build your own style on top of it.</p>
<hr>
<h3>My Technique</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Set your camera to Av mode.</strong><br>
You choose the Aperture (and ISO), and the camera automatically calculates the Shutter Speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose your ISO based on the environment.</strong><br>
• Indoors: around <strong>ISO 1600</strong><br>
• Outdoors on a cloudy day: around <strong>ISO 400</strong><br>
• Bright sunny day or beach: <strong>ISO 200</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose your Aperture for creative control.</strong><br>
• <strong>f/4</strong> is a good start for still or slow-moving subjects.<br>
• <strong>f/8</strong> works well for larger or faster‑moving subjects (the wider depth of field gives you a bit more “wiggle room”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Now check the Shutter Speed.</strong><br>
Frame your subject as you want it, then look at the speed the camera has chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the Shutter Speed too slow?</strong><br>
If it’s below <strong>1/100</strong> (or whatever minimum you’re comfortable holding steady), increase the ISO to speed things up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is the Shutter Speed very fast?</strong><br>
If it’s above <strong>1/1500</strong>, you can probably afford to lower the ISO. This reduces noise and keeps your image cleaner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>And that’s your balance</h3>
<p>With ISO and Aperture set thoughtfully, the camera will give you a usable Shutter Speed — and you maintain creative control.</p>
<p>These numbers are only guides. As you experiment with different conditions and subjects, you’ll quickly learn what works best for you. It might seem like a lot at first, but remember: photography is part art, part practice. The intellectual bit becomes instinctive with repetition.</p>
<p>Keep shooting, keep playing, and muscle memory will do the rest.</p>
