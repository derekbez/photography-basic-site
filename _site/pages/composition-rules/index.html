      <p><strong>Composition Rules</strong></p>
<h3>Rule 1: There are no rules.</h3>
<p>Truly. Photography is creative, personal, and wonderfully flexible.</p>
<p>But… there <em>are</em> a few guidelines — little tricks that help make images more pleasing, balanced, or emotionally engaging.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Rule 2: Even though there are no rules, this one still applies</h3>
<p><strong>Keep your horizons level.</strong></p>
<p>Few things pull a viewer out of an image faster than a tilted horizon. A leaning sea, a wonky skyline — it’s distracting and uncomfortable, as if the whole world is sliding off the frame.</p>
<p>Try to get your horizons level <em>in camera</em>. Many cameras have electronic level displays to help. You can always fix a slight wobble in Lightroom afterwards, but starting level is best.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Non‑Rule 3: The Rule of Thirds</h3>
<p>If you place your subject dead‑centre, the photo often feels… well, dead. Moving the subject off‑centre adds energy and interest.</p>
<p>Imagine the frame split into <strong>thirds</strong>, with two vertical and two horizontal lines creating nine equal blocks. These invisible lines are your guide.</p>
<p>• Place your subject <em>on</em> one of the lines.<br>
• Even better, place key features (like eyes) on one of the <strong>intersections</strong>.</p>
<p>This applies to horizons too. A horizon placed neatly on the top or bottom third usually feels more balanced than one cutting through the middle.</p>
<div class="img-center">
  <img src="/img/thirds example1.jpg" alt="Eyes on a thirds intersection" class="img-medium">
</div>
<p><em>Eyes on a thirds intersection; body and horizon close to thirds lines too.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>Non‑Rule 4: Avoid background distractions</h3>
<img src="/img/tree-head.jpg" alt="Tree Head" class="img-small float-right">
<p>A lovely portrait loses its charm when a tree appears to be growing out of your subject’s head. The same goes for lamp posts, signs, stray elbows, or anything that doesn’t add to the story.</p>
<p>Often the solution is simple:<br>
Take one step to the left.<br>
Or ask your subject to step to the right.<br>
Small movements can clean a scene dramatically.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Non‑Rule 5: Space</h3>
<p>Space helps guide the viewer and gives your image room to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>5a: Give your subject space to move.</strong><br>
If someone is walking left‑to‑right, place them towards the <strong>left</strong> of the frame so they have somewhere to “walk into”.</p>
<p><strong>5b: Use negative space.</strong><br>
Leaving some blank space — sky, a plain wall, an open field — creates calm, balance, and emphasis on your subject.</p>
<img src="/img/give-space.jpg" alt="Tree Head" class="img-medium">
<p><em>Space to move and negative space helping isolate the subject.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>Non‑Rule 6: Get closer</h3>
<p>This might seem the opposite of giving space, but getting closer often improves a photo. It removes distractions and makes the subject completely clear.</p>
<p>As the saying goes:<br>
“If your pictures aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough.”</p>
<hr>
<h3>Non‑Rule 7: Be odd</h3>
<p>Odd numbers of elements — three birds, five stones, seven flowers — often feel more dynamic than even numbers. Our eyes naturally react well to a bit of asymmetry and imbalance.</p>

</figure>
<hr>
<p>These guidelines are not laws. They’re gentle nudges towards stronger, more engaging photos. Use them, break them, adapt them — whatever suits the story you want to tell.</p>
